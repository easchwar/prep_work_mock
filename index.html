<p>Hi there! The next step in your application process is the online
coding challenge. Before you start it, look over the prepwork we've
prepared for you. Especially if you're new to coding, this prepwork is
meant to introduce you to the programming concepts you'll need to
succeed on the challenge.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tldr" class="anchor" href="#tldr" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>tl;dr</h2>

<p>Read all of this document. But here's the executive summary:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the <strong><a href="./introduction-to-programming-1.md">Introduction to Programming</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Do the <strong><a href="./practice-problems">practice problems</a></strong>. Review the
solutions.</li>
<li>When you're well prepared (and not before), start the challenge! We
don't give any preference to applicants based on how soon they
start the challenge, so take your time to prepare properly!</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="what-is-the-coding-challenge" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-coding-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the coding challenge?</h2>

<p>We will ask you to solve a short coding challenge composed of
<strong>four or five coding problems that measure basic programming
knowledge</strong>. The challenge is timed: <strong>you will have up to 45 minutes
to complete the challenge</strong>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-difficult-is-the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#how-difficult-is-the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How difficult is the challenge?</h2>

<p><strong>The coding challenge is meant to be accessible to everyone</strong>. Many
of our applicants have never programmed before. Everyone should review
these prepwork materials, which are intended to teach you the
fundamental concepts of programming so that you can succeed on the
challenge.</p>

<a id="how-do-i-prepare-for-the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-prepare-for-the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I prepare for the challenge?</h2>

<p><strong>You will want to prepare for the coding challenge so that you do
your best</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First, you should review our Introduction to Programming</strong>. This
will cover the fundamental concepts of programming you'll need to
know. <strong>We recommend that you at least skim them even if you already
know how to program</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./introduction-to-programming-1.md">Introduction To Programming I</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="./introduction-to-programming-2.md">Introduction To Programming II</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="./introduction-to-programming-3.md">Introduction To Programming III</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="./introduction-to-programming-summary.md">Introduction To Programming Summary</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second, we provide practice problems</strong>. Do these after you have read
the three parts of Introduction to Programming:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="./practice-problems">Practice Problems</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Doing the practice problems will build your familiarity with Ruby, and
give you a good idea what the level of difficulty is on the coding
challenge. It is not required, but <strong>we strongly suggest that you
complete all the practice problems before taking the coding
challenge</strong>. We want you to be well prepared.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-programming-language-do-i-write-in" class="anchor" href="#what-programming-language-do-i-write-in" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What programming language do I write in?</h2>

<p>We have designed the challenge to be done in Ruby, which is the
language of Rails. The readings and practice problems we've provided
are in Ruby.</p>

<p>You may also answer the challenge in Python or JavaScript. We will in
no way penalize you for using Python or JavaScript. <strong>You should use
whatever language you are most comfortable with; we want you to do
your best</strong>.</p>

<p>Some languages are not well suited for the coding challenge. If you
know another language and would strongly prefer to answer in that,
please contact us: <a href="mailto:admissions@appacademy.io">admissions@appacademy.io</a>.</p>

<a id="how-soon-should-i-take-the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#how-soon-should-i-take-the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How soon should I take the challenge?</h2>

<p><strong>Take all the time you need to prepare for the challenge</strong>. We want
you to do your best. We do not give any preference to applicants based
on how soon they take the challenge. <strong>Prematurely beginning the
challenge before completing the prepwork will hurt your
application</strong>. Taking your time to prepare thoroughly will help you.</p>

<p>The challenge will take up to 45 minutes. <strong>Please have time set aside
so that you can complete the challenge unhurried by other
commitments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please</strong> do not search Google for answers to the problems; it is
very easy for us to tell when solutions have been taken from Google.
<strong>Please do not post the problems to the internet</strong>.</p>
