{"name":"Prep work mock","tagline":"","body":"# Coding Challenge I\r\n\r\nHi there! The next step in your application process is the online\r\ncoding challenge. Before you start it, look over the prepwork we've\r\nprepared for you. Especially if you're new to coding, this prepwork is\r\nmeant to introduce you to the programming concepts you'll need to\r\nsucceed on the challenge.\r\n\r\n## tl;dr\r\n\r\nRead all of this document. But here's the executive summary:\r\n\r\n0. Read the **[Introduction to Programming][intro-to-programming-1]**.\r\n0. Do the **[practice problems][practice-problems]**. Review the\r\n   solutions.\r\n0. When you're well prepared (and not before), start the challenge! We\r\n   don't give any preference to applicants based on how soon they\r\n   start the challenge, so take your time to prepare properly!\r\n\r\n## What is the coding challenge?\r\n\r\nWe will ask you to solve a short coding challenge composed of\r\n**four or five coding problems that measure basic programming\r\nknowledge**. The challenge is timed: **you will have up to 45 minutes\r\nto complete the challenge**.\r\n\r\n## How difficult is the challenge?\r\n\r\n**The coding challenge is meant to be accessible to everyone**. Many\r\nof our applicants have never programmed before. Everyone should review\r\nthese prepwork materials, which are intended to teach you the\r\nfundamental concepts of programming so that you can succeed on the\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n## How do I setup Ruby?\r\n\r\nPlease see the [setup instructions][setup] document.\r\n\r\n[setup]: ./setup.md\r\n\r\n## How do I prepare for the challenge?\r\n\r\n**You will want to prepare for the coding challenge so that you do\r\nyour best**.\r\n\r\n**First, you should review our Introduction to Programming**. This\r\nwill cover the fundamental concepts of programming you'll need to\r\nknow. **We recommend that you at least skim them even if you already\r\nknow how to program**:\r\n\r\n* **[Introduction To Programming I][intro-to-programming-1]**\r\n* **[Introduction To Programming II][intro-to-programming-2]**\r\n* **[Introduction To Programming III][intro-to-programming-3]**\r\n* **[Introduction To Programming Summary][intro-to-programming-summary]**\r\n\r\n[intro-to-programming-1]: ./introduction-to-programming-1.md\r\n[intro-to-programming-2]: ./introduction-to-programming-2.md\r\n[intro-to-programming-3]: ./introduction-to-programming-3.md\r\n[intro-to-programming-summary]: ./introduction-to-programming-summary.md\r\n\r\n**Second, we provide practice problems**. Do these after you have read\r\nthe three parts of Introduction to Programming:\r\n\r\n* **[Practice Problems][practice-problems]**\r\n\r\n[practice-problems]: ./practice-problems\r\n\r\nDoing the practice problems will build your familiarity with Ruby, and\r\ngive you a good idea what the level of difficulty is on the coding\r\nchallenge. It is not required, but **we strongly suggest that you\r\ncomplete all the practice problems before taking the coding\r\nchallenge**. We want you to be well prepared.\r\n\r\n## What programming language do I write in?\r\n\r\nWe have designed the challenge to be done in Ruby, which is the\r\nlanguage of Rails. The readings and practice problems we've provided\r\nare in Ruby.\r\n\r\nYou may also answer the challenge in Python or JavaScript. We will in\r\nno way penalize you for using Python or JavaScript. **You should use\r\nwhatever language you are most comfortable with; we want you to do\r\nyour best**.\r\n\r\nSome languages are not well suited for the coding challenge. If you\r\nknow another language and would strongly prefer to answer in that,\r\nplease contact us: [admissions@appacademy.io][admissions].\r\n\r\n[admissions]: mailto:admissions@appacademy.io\r\n\r\n## How soon should I take the challenge?\r\n\r\n**Take all the time you need to prepare for the challenge**. We want\r\nyou to do your best. We do not give any preference to applicants based\r\non how soon they take the challenge. **Prematurely beginning the\r\nchallenge before completing the prepwork will hurt your\r\napplication**. Taking your time to prepare thoroughly will help you.\r\n\r\nThe challenge will take up to 45 minutes. **Please have time set aside\r\nso that you can complete the challenge unhurried by other\r\ncommitments.**\r\n\r\n## Can I use Google for answers during the challenge?\r\n\r\n**Please** do not search Google for answers to the problems; it is\r\nvery easy for us to tell when solutions have been taken from Google.\r\n**Please do not post the problems to the internet**.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
